Write and test a Java/Python recursive method for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two non-negative integers using Euclid's algorithm. What is the running time? Hint: The base case is when one of the numbers becomes 0, and the recursive case is gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)

Write and test an efficient Java/Python method for reversing a doubly linked list L using only a constant amount of additional space. Hint: Add the method to DoublyLinkedList class.

Write and test an efficient Java/Python method for finding all elements smaller than a given value X(take input from user) in an array of size n. What is the running time of your algorithm? Hint: Sort the array first and then perform a binary search to find the ending point.
